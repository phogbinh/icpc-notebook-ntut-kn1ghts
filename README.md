# ICPC Notebook NTUT_Kn1ghts
This is the repository for ICPC contests' notebooks of the team *NTUT_Kn1ghts* from National Taipei University of Technology. The team notebook is compiled from codes written by *NTUT_Kn1ghts* team members.

## Generating team notebook
Script for generating the PDF file is `generate_pdf.py`. The script reads the contents of the notebook from `contents.txt`. The LaTeX template that the script uses is `notebook.tex`. It recognizes common file extensions for C/C++/Java/Python and applies syntax highlighting. In order to change the color scheme or add additional languages, both `notebook.tex` and `generate_pdf.py` should be modified accordingly.
